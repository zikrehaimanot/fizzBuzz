     Learning to code can be a fulfilling endeavor. Remember to use all resources available. Whether that be mentors you meet and work with or online peers that can help you through tough challenges.
     There are tricks to every language that you'll pick up with practice so don't feel frustrated if you're struggling to write code efficently.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example senior programmers are having to adjust to the "age of cellphones" and are being tasked with making their websites responsive.This means that if you were to srunch up your screen on a desktop to the smallest possible size ( otherwise known as the mobile version) it should still be aesthetically pleasing. Below you'll find a JavaScript challenge called FizzBuzz. Follow the instructions and give it a shot!
    </p>
    <span>THE QUESTON</span>
    <p>
      Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
     When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    </p>
    <span>If you get stuck and need the solution. Scrunch the screen into mobile version.</span>
    <p class="dontShow"><code>
      for (let n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
        let output = "";
        if (n % 3 == 0) output += "Fizz";
        if (n % 5 == 0) output += "Buzz";
        console.log(output || n);
}


function alert(){
    for (let n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
    let output = "";
    if (n % 3 == 0) output += "Fizz";
    if (n % 5 == 0) output += "Buzz";

}
}
</code>
   </p>
   <p>Put that solution into JSbin and watch the results roll!!!</p>
